This repository contains my CA assignments from the Software Testing module, completed during my third year of Computer Science studies at TU Dublin. 

# Assignment 1 Overview

This assignment focuses on unit testing the backend of the **TunePal music library API**, a system designed to manage a collection of songs with functionalities such as searching, pagination, and filtering. The primary objective was to ensure the correctness, reliability, and performance of core API functions by implementing comprehensive **unit tests** using Python’s `unittest` and `pytest` frameworks.  

Through structured testing, the following aspects of the API were validated: 

- **Song Management:** Adding new songs while preventing duplicates.  
- **Pagination:** Navigating through song listings efficiently.  
- **Search Functionality:** Searching by song title, artist, and handling special characters.  
- **Filtering:** Retrieving songs based on release year.  
- **Error Handling:** Managing invalid inputs gracefully.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring API response times remain ≤ 200ms.  
- **Code Quality Analysis:** Enforcing best practices using `pylint`.  

### Tools & Technologies Used:

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Testing Frameworks:** `unittest`, `pytest`  
- **Test Coverage Analysis:** `coverage`  
- **Code Quality Check:** `pylint`  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code  

By following best practices in software testing, this project ensures robust, maintainable, and high-quality code for the TunePal API, preparing it for seamless integration with the front-end and further system testing.
